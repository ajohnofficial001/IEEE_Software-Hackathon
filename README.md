SmartHome FloodGuard is an innovative and reliable solution designed to protect your home from the devastating effects of water damage caused by leaks and flooding. With advanced sensors and smart technology, FloodGuard offers peace of mind by continuously monitoring the areas most susceptible to water intrusion within your home. Equipped with ultra-sensitive water leak sensors strategically placed in key areas such as under sinks, near water heaters, and in basements, FloodGuard instantly detects the presence of water the moment a leak occurs.
	To this mandate, the SmartHome FloodGuard of this project was born to save families from the dread of losing their homes and loved ones in vain. The project consists of an Arduino MEGA (ELEGOO) microcontroller that serves as the brain, a water level sensor for detecting the presence of water, several connecting wires, resistors, a potentiometer, an LCD screen for displaying the message (used in the absence of WiFi module for email communication and SMS module for calling & messaging updates), and a breadboard hosting all these components. 
	The SmartHome FloodGuard device is activated once in contact with a reasonable contact with water. It measures the water level and triggers the alert system when the threshold level is exceeded. The alert system consists of a buzzer and an LED bulb that changes intensity based on the water level detected. It also consists of an LCD display that explicitly sends a message of the status. The goal is to send a similar distress message (alert), displayed on the screen, to the user's email and SMS in case they are far from home. More importantly, our aim is to seamlessly integrate SmartHome FloodGuard into a mobile device that communicates with everyone in the house.
	Designed to integrate seamlessly into your existing smart home ecosystem, FloodGuard offers unparalleled convenience and reliability, making it the ultimate solution for safeguarding your home against the unexpected threat of water damage. With SmartHome FloodGuard, you can rest easy knowing that your home is protected, giving you the confidence to live life worry-free.
